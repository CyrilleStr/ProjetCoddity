# Projet coddity
## About 
This android application is meant for the [Coddity](https://bourse.coddity.com/) contest and a school project at the Univeristy of Technolgy Belfort-Montb√©liard. It's about climate change awareness. The app main goal is to encourage people to throw trash they can found on a daily basis. This app is a POC of a Pokemon-Go-like app.
### Features
- User can take a picture of a founded trash
- Once the user is next to a bin (referenced on the map), the user confirm that the trash has been thrown (the app check the user location)
- User can validate other users trash with a tinder-like swipe system: they have a picture and they confirm if it's a real trash or not (to avoid abuse)
- User earns points when they throw trash and validate other users trash.
- User can also add bin when they take a picture
